    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an enthusiastic Computer Engineering student at Jamia Millia Islamia, currently pursuing a Diploma. With
            a strong foundational understanding of programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, I have developed the
            ability to approach complex problems with analytical thinking and creativity. My coursework has provided me
            with essential skills in software development, data structures, and algorithm design, while my experience in
            basic Python has further enhanced my programming versatility.
            <br>
            I am passionate about web development and actively seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience in this
            field. My goal is to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical projects that will allow me to build
            scalable and efficient web applications. I am particularly interested in learning more about full-stack
            development and exploring the latest technologies in the industry.
            <br>
            I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute to a dynamic team where I can learn from
            others while sharing my insights. I believe that continuous learning is key to professional growth, and I am
            committed to enhancing my skills and staying updated with industry trends. I am excited about the prospect
            of growing as a developer in a professional setting and making meaningful contributions to innovative
            projects.
